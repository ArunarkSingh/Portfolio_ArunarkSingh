# 👋 Hi, I'm Arunark Singh

I'm an Electrical Engineering student at UBC, specializing in **Robotics, AI, and MEMS systems**.  
I design and simulate intelligent systems that connect **sensing, perception, and control** — from autonomous drones to micro-scale sensors.

## 🧠 Machine Learning & Data Science  
### 1. Credit Card Fraud Detection (Imbalanced Classification) 
Built a validation-tuned fraud detection pipeline under extreme class imbalance, prioritizing recall using precision–recall analysis and threshold optimization.  
**Tech:** Python, scikit-learn, Logistic Regression, PR/ROC Analysis 
🔗 https://github.com/ArunarkSingh/CreditCard_Fraud_Detection_Imbalanced_ML.git

### 2. Fake News Detection with Pretrained Transformers (LIAR Dataset)  
Fine-tuned RoBERTa-base on the LIAR fact-checking dataset (~12k political statements), achieving **60.5% test accuracy (macro-F1 0.587)** on binary classification and **29.4% accuracy (macro-F1 0.297)** on the original 6-class task.  
Developed a FastAPI inference service and generated ROC/PR curves, confusion matrices, and per-class F1 visualizations for evaluation.  
**Tech:** Python, PyTorch, HuggingFace Transformers, RoBERTa, FastAPI, scikit-learn
